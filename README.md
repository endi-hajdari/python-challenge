# Project Title
```Module 3 Challenge:``` Py Me Up, Charlie

# Project Overview 
This challenge is associated with ```Module 3``` of **UofT's 2022-2023 Data Analytics Bootcamp**. Given the large sizes of each of the datasets, Python scripts were created over performing Excel-based analyses. Moreover, two Python scripts were written making use of the ```NumPy``` and ```Pandas``` libraries. These libraries made reading, analyzing, and extracting information from the ```CSV``` files much simpler. The script titled ```PyBank``` was used to analyze a dataset of a company's financial records, and the script titled ``` PyPoll``` was used to analyze the results of a local election.

# Repository Structure Breakdown
- Inside this repository, there are two folders titled ```PyBank``` and ```PyPoll```. Each folder houses the contents for each specific Python-based analysis.
- In each folder, the following content may be found:
    - A file called ```main.py```. This is the main script that was run for each respective analysis;
    - A ```Resources``` folder that contains the ```CSV``` files used for each respective analysis;
    - An ```Analysis``` folder that contains a ```TXT``` file that has the main results from each respective analysis;
    - A ```ipynb``` file of the main script run for each respective analysis, but saved as a Jupyter Notebook file;
    - A ```CSV``` file that was used for each respective analysis; and
    - A ```TXT``` file that has the main results from each respective analysis.
    
# PyBank Project Description
In this Challenge, a Python script was created to analyze the financial records of a company. The financial dataset used in the analysis was called ```budget_data.csv```. The dataset was composed of two columns: ```Date``` and ```Profit/Losses```. The Python script created analyzed the records to calculate each of the following values:
- The ```total number of months``` included in the dataset;
- The ```net total amount``` of ```Profit/Losses``` over the entire period;
- The changes in ```Profit/Losses``` over the entire period, and then the ```average``` of those changes;
- The ```greatest increase``` in profits (date and amount) over the entire period; and
- The ```greatest decrease``` in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final script both printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a ```TXT``` file titled ```PyBank.txt``` with the results. The results of the analysis were as follows:

# PyPoll Project Description
In this Challenge, a Python script was created to aid a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The poll dataset used in the analysis was called ```election_data.csv```. The dataset was composed of three columns: ```Voter ID```, ```County```, and ```Candidate```. The Python script created analyzed the votes and calculated each of the following values:
- The ```total number of votes cast```;
- A complete list of ```candidates``` who received votes;
- The ```percentage``` of votes each candidate won;
- The ```total number of votes each candidate won```; and
- The ```winner``` of the election based on popular vote.

The final script both printed the analysis to the terminal and exported a ```TXT``` file titled ```PyPoll.txt``` with the results. The results of the analysis were as follows:
